## Overview

This repository powers AtonixCorp‚Äôs modular computation and storage backbone ‚Äî the internal stack supporting scalable services, data persistence, distributed coordination, and microservice orchestration. This is **not** a general company profile ‚Äî it is the *infrastructure layer* that underpins our domain-specific tools across medicine, agriculture, security, and advanced analytics.
